  <h3>// Writing</h3>
  <p>I occasionally blog about technical stuff at my github <a href="https://avanpo.github.io/">pages</a>. I just started this, but hope to fill it with things I learn as I go.</p>
  <h3>// School</h3>
  <p>I have a B.Math from the University of Waterloo, Canada. Right now I'm in the middle of a M.Sc. at Utrecht University. My specialization is algorithm design and complexity. I also dabble in crypto and appsec in my spare time.</p>
  <h3>// Personal</h3>
  <p>I like to stay active. I've done a lot of different sports in my life, but right now I play volleyball and powerlift.</p>
  <p>I also have interests in traveling, cooking, and generally enjoying the finer things in life.</p>

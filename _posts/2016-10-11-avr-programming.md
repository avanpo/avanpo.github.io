## The Arduino Nano

The Nano is a very simple board, essentially just an AVR <abbr title="Microcontroller unit">MCU</abbr> with an FTDI chip for communicating over USB.  On the top left of the schematic[^1] is the pinout of the board, and in the centre is the pinout of the AVR chip (an ATmega328 or ATmega328p)[^2].

You can follow the pins to various components, and/or directly to the pins of the board itself.  For example, the `D0/TX` and `D1/RX` pins on the board are connected to the `PD0` and `PD1` pins of the AVR, which are the <abbr title="Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter">UART</abbr> TX and RX pins.  The schematic is confusing at first but gets simpler once you see that every label is unique, and anywhere a label appears multiple times means they are connected at those points within the board.  So, in the case of the `D0` and `D1` pins, they are connected to the AVR directly *before* the 1k resistors `RP1B` and `RP1C`, which are in turn connected to the `TXD` and `RXD` pins of the FT232RL (via the `RX` and `TX` labels, respectively).  The FT232RL chip[^3] is a USB slave to UART converter that connects to the mini-USB connector (labelled `USB-MINI-B%C`).

The on-board voltage regulator `UA78M05`[^4] accepts 7â€“25 V as input via `VIN`, and outputs a regulated 5 V up to 500 mA.  Alternatively, USB can power the board directly.  The components thus use a 5 V logic level to communicate binary signals.  A binary signal is a form of modulation (the concept of encoding data within a signal, in this case electrical) using voltage level to determine a *high* value or a *low* value.  The ''logic level'' determines the actual voltages used, in our case 5 V for *high* and 0 V for *low*.  Whether *high* is considered a logical 1 (active-high) or a logical 0 (active-low) is dependent on the pin configuration.  When a pin is configured to be active-low, it is usually labelled with a bar over it (as in `RESET`{:.overline}) or appended with a `#`, but other conventions are also used.

What you can tell from the schematic is that the UART pins of the AVR are directly connected to the pins of the board, but also connected to the FT232R.  You can also tell that the FT232R is only connected to the AVR using these 2 pins, beyond a few power and reset pins.  So if the computer (via USB) is only able to communicate with the FT232R, then clearly your only method of communicating with the AVR is via the UART.  We will look at how to use the UART in a later section.

## Using the GNU toolchain

We can use gcc and GNU binutils to program the AVR.  For most systems, you will need to install a separate instance of gcc and binutils built to target AVR.  The toolchain modules are invoked using the prefix `avr-`; all the same flags and features are available.

After cross-compiling a program for AVR, the resulting binary needs to be written to the flash and/or eeprom using a ''programmer''.  The programmer requires a physical connection to the AVR, and uses an algorithm specified in the datasheet (chapter 28) to write the passed program to the chip.  The usual tool for interfacing with the programmer is avrdude[^5].  We will be using a programmer called *arduino*, which is really just the Arduino bootloader[^6] pre-loaded in the AVR's memory.  The bootloader reads the binary via the UART and writes to the application memory space.

The linker produces ELF-formatted binaries by default, but this programmer doesn't accept those.  Instead, we use Intel hex format binaries:

```shell
avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega328p -Wl,--oformat=ihex -o program.hex program.c
```

Then we tell avrdude to upload the binary:

```shell
avrdude -p atmega328p -c arduino -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 57600 -D -U flash:w:program.hex:i
```

How do we know the baud rate should be 57600?  Well, avrdude is communicating directly with the bootloader, so all we have to do is look at the [bootloader code](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/59b5311cdffbf239d956fc97f01091006bc4aaa3/hardware/arduino/avr/bootloaders/atmega/Makefile#L155).

## The Microcontroller

So far this doesn't look too foreign.  The differences show up when we try to actually write a program for the AVR.  An MCU does not have the same features as a microprocessor.  There is no kernel/user mode distinction, so the usual abstracted functions to access operating system services do not exist, as there is no operating system to speak of.  There is only one process, delineated by the `main()` function, as process preemption requires a multitasking operating system (generally facilitated by virtual memory, which MCUs do not have).  As such, your program must do all hardware initialization explicitly.  Fortunately, MCUs are simple enough that this is a reasonable task.

We can use avr-libc[^7] to provide basic macros and functions.  The project attempts to mimic the C standard library, with the limitation that there is no operating system for hardware abstraction.  The header file [\<avr/io.h\>](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__io.html) supplies macros for the registers of most available chips, and [\<avr/interrupt.h\>](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__interrupts.html) supplies macros for interrupt vectors and initialization routines.

Here is the AVR pinout from the datasheet, which you can cross-reference with the Arduino schematic:

![ATmega328 pinout]({{ site.github.url }}/assets/ATmega48--328 28 PDIP.png)

The chip is configured as having 3 ''ports'': Port B (corresponding to `PBn` pins), Port C (`PCn`), and Port D (`PDn`).  The idea is that each port has 8 pins (except Port C, read *Pin Descriptions* in section 1.1) for parallel communication of bytes when configured for regular digital I/O (the default).  Within each port, each pin also has alternatively configurable functions, which correspond to the parenthesized labels.  So the UART pins, `RXD` and `TXD`, are alternative functions of the Port D pins 0 and 1.  Other alternative functions include clock inputs (`XTALn`, timers/counters and <abbr title="Pulse-Width Modulator">PWM</abbr>s (`OCnx`), external interrupts (`PCINTn`), serial protocols like SPI (`SCK`, `MISO`, `MOSI`, `SS`) and I<sup>2</sup>C, <abbr title="Analog-Digital Converter">ADC</abbr>s (`ADCn`), and more.

When the MCU begins program execution, no alternative pin functions are initialized.  The only exception is `PC6`, which is programmed with a fuse bit to configure reset functionality.  All other port pins are set as tri-stated inputs (high-impedance, i.e. won't source or sink current), and interrupts are disabled.  The program must then configure how each pin should be used.  A simple program could be to set Port B as an output, and increment the value input on Port D:

```c
#include <avr/io.h>

int main (void)
{
    DDRB = 0xff;
    while (1) PORTB = 1 + PIND;
    return 0;
}
```

The <abbr title="Data Direction Register">`DDRx`</abbr> registers determine whether each pin of the corresponding port is an output or an input.  Setting the register to `0xff` configures all Port B pins as outputs.  To specify only certain pins, we use the macro `_BV`, which is equivalent to `(1 << Pxn)`:

```c
DDRB |= _BV(PB0);      // To set PB0 as an output
DDRB &= ~_BV(PB0);     // To set PB0 as an input
```

The `PORTx` registers are writeable I/O memory addresses to toggle outputs on the respective port.  The `PINx` registers are readable addresses for capturing inputs.  avr-libc hides the specific addresses within these macro definitions for each chip by including chip-specific header files in the \<avr/io.h\> header, switched by the `-mmcu` compiler flag.

We use an infinite loop so that we are continuously sampling the input at Port D.  Alternatively, we could set `PORTB` once, and then put the MCU to sleep to latch the value determined at program start.

## The UART

A UART is a simple device for serial communication.  Serial means data is sent in sequence over the same wire, as opposed to having, say, 8 wires transmit a byte all at once (called parallel communication).  When two UARTs are connected for communication, the transmit pin `TX` of one is wired to the receive pin `RX` of the other, and vice versa.  Both the AVR and the FT232R are full-duplex, meaning they can transmit and receive simultaneously, without having to take turns (half-duplex).  On the host (computer) side, the FT232R driver exposes the communication as a [TTY interface](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO.html), which acts like a pipe to the FT232R.  So if you write a character to the TTY (generally will be /dev/ttyUSB0), a data frame containing that character will pop out at the `TXD` pin of the FT232R, which is then connected to the `RXD` pin of the AVR.  Conversely, if you program the AVR to transmit a character, it will send a data frame from its `TXD` pin, which is received by the `RXD` pin of the FT232R, which the Linux driver than decodes and writes to the TTY.  If you then read from the TTY (e.g. `cat /dev/ttyUSB0`), you will retrieve the sent character.

Because UARTs are asynchronous, and do not have a clock line for synchronization, they must synchronize over the same lines used for data transmission.  This is only possible if the [baud rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud) (same as the bit rate when using binary modulation) and frame format are agreed upon prior to communication.  UARTs use a prescaler to divide the provided clock to a desired baud rate.  With a given clock frequency, only a set number of baud rates can be configured.

Section 20.10 of the AVR datasheet has a table of baud rate calculations for commonly-used clock frequencies.  Not all standard baud rates are available for every frequency---due to the discrete number of prescaler values available---so the error to the nearest standard baud rate is listed.  The range of acceptable errors is tabulated in section 20.8.3.  To configure the baud rate, avr-libc provides macros in [\<util/setbaud.h\>](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__util__setbaud.html).  To configure framing, we set the *USART Control and Data Registers* as outlined in section 20.4.  The default is 8 data bits, no parity, and 1 stop bit---commonly used for serial communication with PCs.

For the FT232R, you can set the baud rate via the Linux TTY driver.  `stty` is a [program](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/stty-invocation.html) used to alter TTY settings, including baud rate and frame format.  You can also affect the TTY programmatically, via the [termios structure](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html) in [libc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Low_002dLevel-Terminal-Interface.html).  The datasheet specifies prescaler options in section 4.2:

> [ ... ] baud rates are calculated as follows -
>
> $$Baud Rate = \frac{3000000}{n + x}$$
>
> Where $$n$$ can be any integer between 2 and 16,384 ( = 2<sup>14</sup> ) and $$x$$ can be a sub-integer of the value 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, or 0.875. When $$n = 1, x = 0$$, i.e. baud rate divisors with values between 1 and 2 are not possible.

As an example, we could write a simple program that accepts characters from the host, and sends each character back incremented by one:

```c
#include <avr/io.h>

#define F_CPU 16000000
#define BAUD 38400
#include <util/setbaud.h>

int main(void)
{
    UBRR0H = UBRRH_VALUE;               // UBRR is a 12-bit prescaler register
    UBRR0L = UBRRL_VALUE;               // The value is determined by util/setbaud.h
    UCSR0B = _BV(TXEN0) | _BV(RXEN0);   // This enables the UART pins
    char c;
    while (1) {
        loop_until_bit_is_set(UCSR0A, RXC0);    // Wait for a character
        c = UDR0;
        loop_until_bit_is_set(UCSR0A, UDRE0);   // Ensure the transmit buffer is empty
        UDR0 = c + 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

We set our clock rate `F_CPU` to match the frequency of the external crystal seen in the schematic.  Then we select a baud rate that has a suitable error for both the AVR and the FTDI.

Finally, we block on the values of `RXC0` and `UDRE0` to know when the receive and transmit buffers are ready for reading and writing, respectively.

## Simulating and debugging

We can use [simavr](https://github.com/buserror/simavr) to simulate many AVR chips locally, including the ATmega328.  simavr has <abbr title="The GNU debugger">GDB</abbr> and <abbr title="Value-Change Dump">VCD</abbr> support, which is especially helpful to those who don't have access to an oscilloscope, or don't have an AVR at all.

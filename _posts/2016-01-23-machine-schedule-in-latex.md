Recently I worked on a project about the Job Shop Problem, and came across the need to visualize the machine schedules that were being generated. A quick search revealed the type of diagram I was looking for to be the Gantt chart. There's a lot of tools that can produce these kinds of charts from data, like this [python script](https://github.com/losalamos/Gazebo/blob/master/bin/util/Gantt/gantt.py) in combination with gnuplot. However, I wasn't looking to make a chart from data, and preferred to do it inside LaTeX, without embedding any images. Gnuplot can output latex code, but it seemed like an unnecessary hassle.

Enter the [pgfgantt](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgfgantt) package. There's a wealth of information in the documentation, but some things aren't immediately apparent. For example, machine schedules aren't Gantt charts in the most usual sense, in which each row has exactly one bar. How do we fit multiple bars on the same row? I was looking to produce the following chart:

After some searching and tinkering, I came up with the following LaTeX markup below. It generated the image above.

```latex
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{pgfgantt}
\definecolor{blue}{HTML}{74BBC9}
\definecolor{yellow}{HTML}{F7E967}

\begin{document}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{ganttchart}[
		x unit=0.7cm,
		y unit chart=0.7cm,
		canvas/.style={draw=none,fill=none},
		vgrid,
		vgrid={*1{draw=black!12}},
		inline,
		group/.style={draw=none,fill=none},
		bar top shift=0.1,
		bar height=0.8,
		y unit title=0.5cm,
		title/.style={draw=none,fill=none},
		include title in canvas=false,
	]{-1}{12}

	\gantttitle{0}{2}
	\gantttitle{2}{2}
	\gantttitle{4}{2}
	\gantttitle{6}{2}
	\gantttitle{8}{2}
	\gantttitle{10}{2}
	\gantttitle{12}{2} \\

	\ganttgroup[inline=false]{$T_{1,1}$}{0}{1}
	\ganttbar[bar/.style={fill=yellow}]{5}{3}{4}
	\ganttbar[bar/.style={fill=blue}]{3}{6}{7} \\

	\ganttgroup[inline=false]{$T_{1,2}$}{0}{1}
	\ganttbar[bar/.style={fill=blue}]{2}{2}{5}
	\ganttbar[bar/.style={fill=yellow}]{6}{6}{8} \\

	\ganttgroup[inline=false]{$T_{2,1}$}{0}{1}
	\ganttbar[bar/.style={fill=blue}]{1}{0}{1}
	\ganttbar[bar/.style={fill=yellow}]{7}{9}{11} \\
	
	\ganttgroup[inline=false]{$T_{3,1}$}{0}{1}
	\ganttbar[bar/.style={fill=yellow}]{4}{0}{2}

\end{ganttchart}
\caption{A flexible job shop schedule}
\label{fig:schedule}
\end{figure}

\end{document}
```

So how does this work? I've defined the gantt group and gantt titles to have invisible backgrounds, to form the y-axis and x-axis coordinates respectively. The `inline` ensures that the `\ganttbar`s have their text inside the bar. The `inline` is removed for the `\ganttgroup`s so that their values sit outside the chart. The rest of the parameters and style changes are fairly self-explanatory.

I started the chart at -1 in order to perfectly align the 2-wide gantt titles over the vertical grid. This is a bit of a hack, I'm sure there's better ways to do this. Ideally, I also would have liked to left-align the values inside the bars, but I wasn't able to figure out how to do that properly. Perhaps I'll figure out how to do that someday.
